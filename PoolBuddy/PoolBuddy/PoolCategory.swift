As a sand filter collects dirt, its efficiency increases, trapping more dirt. When your pressure gauge shows a reading 8 - 10 lbs. over the clean, start-up reading, it is time to backwash the captured dirt out of the filter. \nSand filters are known to be the lowest maintenance of the three types of pool filters. You may only need to open up the tank every 5 years or so. DE filters require removing the internal grid assembly at least annually to clean them well, and cartridge filters don't backwash, you remove the cartridge and hose clean every so often, depending on the cartridge filter size. Sand filters are the easiest to operate and maintain.\n\"They say\" that the sand inside a sand filter should be replaced after seven years. Gradual loss of efficiency may be hard to notice. If your sand filter requires frequent backwashing, every week or two, the sand bed may be \"mudballed\", or it may be \"channeled\". It may also \"calcify\" with calcium deposits. Other water balance problems may also contribute to pool filter sand deterioration, but a properly sized sand filter could go over 10 years between sand changes."))

The cartridge filter element, an aquatic version of the pleated air filter in your car, traps dirt and particles of 25 - 100 microns in size. The cartridge is removed from the tank and hosed thoroughly, top to bottom, with a high pressure hose to remove dirt when the pressure gauge rises 8 - 10 lbs. above its clean reading. I know some people that take their cartridges to the local self serve car wash place for cleaning, but too much pressure may damage the cartridge. Each time the cartridge filter element is cleaned, some of its filtering ability is reduced.\nThe cartridge should be replaced every 3 - 5 yrs, depending on the work it was asked to do. If the filter was a bit undersized, and had some algae every year and lots of tree debris, etc. then it may last only 1 - 2 years. Nicely sized cartridge filters can operate for 6 months between cleanings and get more than 5 yrs from the cartridges."))

As the pump circulates the pool's water, the water drawn from the pool passes through a filter and then to the heater. The gas burns in the heater's combustion chamber, generating heat that transfers to the water that's returned to the pool.\nThey're most efficient when heating pools for short periods of time, and they're ideal for quickly heating pools. Therefore, gas pool heaters can be a good choice for pools that aren't used on a regular basis. Unlike heat pump and solar pool heaters, gas pool heaters can maintain any desired temperature regardless of the weather or climate.\n\nHeat Pumps: Heat pumps use electricity to capture heat and move it from one place to another. They don't generate heat.\nAs the pool pump circulates the swimming pool's water, the water drawn from the pool passes through a filter and the heat pump heater. The heat pump heater has a fan that draws in the outside air and directs it over the evaporator coil. Liquid refrigerant within the evaporator coil absorbs the heat from the outside air and becomes a gas. The warm gas in the coil then passes through the compressor. The compressor increases the heat, creating a very hot gas that then passes through the condenser. The condenser transfers the heat from the hot gas to the cooler pool water circulating through the heater. The heated water then returns to the pool. The hot gas, as it flows through the condenser coil, returns to liquid form and back to the evaporator, where the whole process begins again."))

Most pools have efficiency in sanitizing, filtering and circulation such that they don't need to operate 24 hours a day. Pools are designed to \"turnover\" the water in the pool in eight hours time. We commonly set time clocks to operate 10 - 14 hours per day, depending on the efficiency of the system, the ambient air temperature, amount of sunlight and debris and the usage the pool receives.\nI commonly advise pool owners to operate the filter system during the day, so that processes are active while the sun is beating down and the pool is most likely to be in use. This would be something like 9 a.m. - 9 p.m. You may realize lower electrical consumption if you didn't operate between 12 p.m. - 6 p.m.... peak sunlight hours.... You decide.\nSetting a time clock is simple. Inside the box you'll see a 24 hour dial. There are two \"timer dogs\" on the dial. One turns the timer switch on, allowing power to go to the filter pump, and the other turns the switch off, stopping power from going past the timer to the filter pump. Loosening the small screw on the timer dog allows you to slide the dog to any time on the dial. Reposition and retighten."))

Many sand filters use a top mounted multiport valve, located on the top center of the filter tank. The advantages of a Multiport valve are that they have, well, multiple ports. This allows for more options than simply Filter or Backwash.\n\nMultiport valves usually have 6 positions (Some Jacuzzi valves have 7 and some American valves have 8). The positions are usually labeled: Filter, Backwash, Rinse,Example of a Multiport Valve Recirculate, Closed and Drain/Waste. These are described below in more detail.\n\nWhen you move the multiport valve from Filter to Backwash, (always shut pump off first) you are reversing the direction of water into and out of the filter.

        products.append(PoolData(label: "Chlorine Generator", image: "chlorineGenerator", label2: "", image2: "", description: "One of the first alternative sanitizers introduced to the pool and spa industry was the chlorine generator. Chlorine generators are attractive to pool owners simply because they eliminate the need to store, buy, transport and handle chlorine. They are not an alternative to chlorine, but actually make their own chlorine from regular table salt. The pool water passes through a generator cell that creates the chlorine within the pool water.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nAs pool water passes through the chlorine generator cell, pumped through by your filter pump, the salt in the water is turned into Hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid is the exact same component that is produced when any chlorine is added to pool water, whether you use sticks, tablets, granular or liquid. As the water returns to the pool, it will introduce the newly produced chlorine, preventing algae, bacteria and killing micro-organisms, creating a safe and sanitary swimming environment.\n\nOK?  How does it really work?\n\nThis mild, pleasant saline water is sanitized through the process of electrolysis, as mentioned above. The electrolytic cell, through the use of a small electric current, breaks down the water into its basic elements, Hydrogen and Oxygen. By adding small quantities of granulated salt (much like household table salt - NaCI), Hypochlorous Acid (common chlorine) is produced. During the process, the Hypochlorous Acid (Chlorine) is ultimately converted back to salt. Thus, the salt does not get \"used up\". Salt only needs to be \"topped off\" once or twice a year and only to replace salt lost due to water splash-out, bather drag off or filter backwashing.\n\nSalt in My Pool?\n\nThe salt level required to maintain a safe, chlorinated pool is about 2500 to 4000 PPM (parts per million). The human body cannot taste salt until the PPM is around 5000. As a reference point, the ocean is around 40000 ppm. The amount of salt in the pool is usually not noticeable. Once the salt is added to the pool, there is no need to add salt on a yearly basis unless the pool is drained or a significant amount of water is removed. Also, the salt level is low enough so there is no danger of equipment corrosion. Chlorine generator users also report the water is softer, leaving a more refreshed feeling after swimming."))

Shock-treat after sundown with the pump and filter turned on. After a shock treatment, test the free available chlorine. Don't enter the pool until the reading is 1.0 to 3.0 PPM. If it's too high, allow the chlorine to evaporate naturally."))

When a pool smells strongly of Chlorine, what smells is not free available chlorine, but Chloramines . When testing for Free and Total Chlorine with a DPD or other capable pool test kit, the level of combined chlorine molecules in your pool can be detected. The formula is quite simple. The difference between Free Chlorine reading and the Total Chlorine reading is the Combined Chlorine reading. Anything over 0.3ppm should be treated to bring the level down by removing the Chloramines from the pool.\n\nChloramines can be removed from the water by the following three methods:\n\n\t1. By adding a mega-dose of chlorine. Usually 3 to 6 times more chlorine than a normal dose is added to the water, or the level of chlorine is raised to 5 to 10 ppm and held there for 4 hours. This is called super-chlorination. To remove chloramines, the ratio of chlorine to ammonia must be at least 7.6 to 1. If this ratio is not obtained, then more chloramines will be produced. A threshold of \"breakpoint chlorination\" must be reached where total oxidation takes place. This \"shock\" to the pool will rip apart the molecular combinations, and destroy chloramines. Swimmers and bathers should not enter the water until the level of chlorine has dropped to 3 ppm or less.\n\n\t2. By adding a non-chlorine shock to the water. The most common chemical used for this is potassium peroxymonosulfate. This \"shocking\" requires the addition of one pound of shock for each 10,000 gallons of pool water. The same threshold of breakpoint oxidation must be reached when using non-chlorine shock. So, feel free to add a little extra, just to be sure.\n\n\t3. By adding ozone to the water. If an ozone generator is installed on a pool or spa, then oxidation of the ammonia and nitrogen compounds will take place whenever the ozone system is operating. The longer the system operates, the more the ozone can destroy the ammonia and nitrogen. Although most ozone systems operate only when the pool or spa pump is operating, there are 24 -hour systems available which will continuously oxidize ammonia and nitrogen as they enter the water.\n\nRemember, when you smell a strong chlorine odor in a pool - and your eyes are red, it's not because there is too much [free] chlorine in the water, but too much Combined Chlorine. Free chlorine by itself does not smell, nor sting the eyes. The solution to this is to add a whole lot more chlorine, to reach breakpoint chlorination, where the molecular combination of chlorine and nitrogen [or ammonia] will be removed. At least for a while."))

Below 7.0 and a substance is defined as being acidic, while levels above 7 are said to be basic or alkaline. Everything that enters your pool has a pH value. Ever heard of acid rain? This is rainfall with a very low pH. The human eye at a pH value of 7.35, is just slightly basic. This is, coincidentally, in range with proper pH levels for your pool. To have pH in balance we adjust the water with additions of pH increasers (bases) or pH de-creasers (acids) to achieve the range of 7.2 - 7.8.\n\nIf your testing (recommended daily) of the water shows a pH value below 7.0 the water is in a corrosive (acidic) condition and you will need to add a base to bring the pH into a more basic range to prevent corrosion. It doesn't take too long for a low pH condition to weaken vinyl, strip heat exchangers and pit plaster. Conversely, if the pH is above 7.8, we are in a scaling (basic) condition and must add an acid to bring down the pH to prevent the formation of scale or calcium deposits on our tile, in the filter, or even precipitation out of solution into a cloudy water condition."))

Also known as the buffering capacity of the water, alkalinity keeps the pH from \"bouncing\" all over the place. Low alkalinity is raised by the addition of a base (similar to pH); sodium bicarbonate is commonly used. High levels of alkalinity are lowered by the addition of an acid (similar to pH).\n\nWe recommend \"pooling\" the acid in a small area of low current for a greater effect on alkalinity.  That is, adding an acid underwater, in a deep end corner will create a greater hydrocarbon exchange and have a greater effect on lowering TA in your pool. Acids will lower both pH and alkalinity, but walking the acid around the pool in a highly distributed manner is said to have a greater effect lowering the pH than the alkalinity. Pooling the acid has the opposite effect. Some manufacturers notably United Chemicals, have created acids specifically designed to lower Alkalinity strongly, while having little effect on pH.\n\nA very important component of water balance, alkalinity should be maintained in the 80-120ppm range for \"gunite\" and concrete pools and 125-170ppm for painted, vinyl, and fiberglass pools.

It is a combination of carbonate ions, a part of total alkalinity and calcium, and a part of the Calcium Hardness level. The test for Calcium Hardness is a measure of how \"hard\" or \"soft\" the water is. \"Hard\" water can have high levels of calcium and magnesium. If these levels are too high, the water becomes saturated and will throw off excess particles out of solution which then seeks to deposit themselves on almost any surface inside the pool. They can be attracted to ladders, lights and in extreme cases deposit themselves as very small crystalline clumps - all over the pool surfaces. Calcium Carbonate scale; a \"white-ish,\" crystallized rough nodule.\n\nIf the Calcium Hardness levels are too low, the water is under-saturated. If under-saturated, the water will become aggressive as it attempts to obtain the calcium it needs. Such \"soft-water\" will actually corrode surfaces inside the pool which contain calcium (like pool plaster) and other minerals to maintain its hardness demand.\n\nIf your Calcium Hardness levels are too high you can use a product called CalTreat to correct. Designed by United Chemical Corp., one bottle per 15000 gals can reduce Calcium Hardness levels within range. In most cases you need not worry if your calcium levels are below 500, but much higher than that and it can cause pool problems. It can also be accomplished by dilution (adding water to the pool which has a lower calcium hardness content). Levels which are too low require the addition of calcium chloride. Recommended range for calcium hardness is 200-400ppm. Calcium Hardness levels should be tested weekly with fresh reagents or strips."))

Sold commercially as \"Pool Conditioner\" or \"Pool Stabilizer\", cyanuric acid sales amount to millions of metric tons per year for swimming pools and water treatment facilities.\n\nCyanuric Acid, or CYA as it is sometimes called, also saves millions of dollars in chlorine cost for pool operators and pool owners, who add it directly to the pool water, in a granular, flake or liquid form. Once added to the pool water, it seeks out and bonds to Free Chlorine molecules, reducing their activity, and thereby reducing the ability of UV rays to destroy the molecule.\n\nCyanuric acid is also used by pool chlorine manufacturers to create chlorinated cyanurates. Sodium Dichlor pool shock is a stabilized form of granular chlorine, a compound formed of sodium salts. Trichlor tablets are produced by further chlorinating the Dichlor into Trichlor compounds, and pressing them into a tablet. These pre-stabilized chlorinated cyanurate products contain a small amount of cyanuric acid, which is added to the pool as the chlorine is released.\n\nWhat is the Best Level for pool stabilizer?\n\nSwimming pool operators should maintain a level of 10-20 ppm on a shady pool and 20-40 ppm on a sunny pool. The pool should be diluted with fresh water if the cyanuric acid level exceeds 50 ppm. Too much pool stabilizer will reduce the power of your chlorine, and require more free chlorine levels to ensure full sanitation."))

This includes anything present in water other than the pure water (H20) molecule and suspended solids. (Suspended solids are any particles/substances that are neither dissolved nor settled in the water, such as wood pulp.)\n\nIn general, the total dissolved solids concentration is the sum of the cations (positively charged) and anions (negatively charged) ions in the water.\n\nParts per Million (ppm) is the weight-to-weight ratio of any ion to water.\n\nA TDS meter is based on the electrical conductivity (EC) of water. Pure H20 has virtually zero conductivity. Conductivity is usually about 100 times the total cations or anions expressed as equivalents. TDS is calculated by converting the EC by a factor of 0.5 to 1.0 times the EC, depending upon the levels. Typically, the higher the level of EC, the higher the conversion factor to determine the TDS."))
