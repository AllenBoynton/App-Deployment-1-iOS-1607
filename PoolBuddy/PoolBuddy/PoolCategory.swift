Clear water can pass through these openings, but particles as small as one to three microns are trapped during the first pass through the media. Pro Grid includes a manual air-relief valve and a top-mounted pressure gauge for easy access and readability. The high-impact grid elements are designed for up-flow filtration and top-down backwashing for maximum efficiency. An integral lift handle and low-profile base make removal of the grid assembly fast and simple. Combining these high-technology features and a 'service-ease' design for an unparalleled filtration value, the D.E. Filter is for the quality conscious pool owner."))

As a sand filter collects dirt, its efficiency increases, trapping more dirt. When your pressure gauge shows a reading 8 - 10 lbs. over the clean, start-up reading, it is time to backwash the captured dirt out of the filter. \nSand filters are known to be the lowest maintenance of the three types of pool filters. You may only need to open up the tank every 5 years or so. DE filters require removing the internal grid assembly at least annually to clean them well, and cartridge filters don't backwash, you remove the cartridge and hose clean every so often, depending on the cartridge filter size. Sand filters are the easiest to operate and maintain.\n\"They say\" that the sand inside a sand filter should be replaced after seven years. Gradual loss of efficiency may be hard to notice. If your sand filter requires frequent backwashing, every week or two, the sand bed may be \"mudballed\", or it may be \"channeled\". It may also \"calcify\" with calcium deposits. Other water balance problems may also contribute to pool filter sand deterioration, but a properly sized sand filter could go over 10 years between sand changes."))

The cartridge filter element, an aquatic version of the pleated air filter in your car, traps dirt and particles of 25 - 100 microns in size. The cartridge is removed from the tank and hosed thoroughly, top to bottom, with a high pressure hose to remove dirt when the pressure gauge rises 8 - 10 lbs. above its clean reading. I know some people that take their cartridges to the local self serve car wash place for cleaning, but too much pressure may damage the cartridge. Each time the cartridge filter element is cleaned, some of its filtering ability is reduced.\nThe cartridge should be replaced every 3 - 5 yrs, depending on the work it was asked to do. If the filter was a bit undersized, and had some algae every year and lots of tree debris, etc. then it may last only 1 - 2 years. Nicely sized cartridge filters can operate for 6 months between cleanings and get more than 5 yrs from the cartridges."))

As the pump circulates the pool's water, the water drawn from the pool passes through a filter and then to the heater. The gas burns in the heater's combustion chamber, generating heat that transfers to the water that's returned to the pool.\nThey're most efficient when heating pools for short periods of time, and they're ideal for quickly heating pools. Therefore, gas pool heaters can be a good choice for pools that aren't used on a regular basis. Unlike heat pump and solar pool heaters, gas pool heaters can maintain any desired temperature regardless of the weather or climate.\n\nHeat Pumps: Heat pumps use electricity to capture heat and move it from one place to another. They don't generate heat.\nAs the pool pump circulates the swimming pool's water, the water drawn from the pool passes through a filter and the heat pump heater. The heat pump heater has a fan that draws in the outside air and directs it over the evaporator coil. Liquid refrigerant within the evaporator coil absorbs the heat from the outside air and becomes a gas. The warm gas in the coil then passes through the compressor. The compressor increases the heat, creating a very hot gas that then passes through the condenser. The condenser transfers the heat from the hot gas to the cooler pool water circulating through the heater. The heated water then returns to the pool. The hot gas, as it flows through the condenser coil, returns to liquid form and back to the evaporator, where the whole process begins again."))

Most pools have efficiency in sanitizing, filtering and circulation such that they don't need to operate 24 hours a day. Pools are designed to \"turnover\" the water in the pool in eight hours time. We commonly set time clocks to operate 10 - 14 hours per day, depending on the efficiency of the system, the ambient air temperature, amount of sunlight and debris and the usage the pool receives.\nI commonly advise pool owners to operate the filter system during the day, so that processes are active while the sun is beating down and the pool is most likely to be in use. This would be something like 9 a.m. - 9 p.m. You may realize lower electrical consumption if you didn't operate between 12 p.m. - 6 p.m.... peak sunlight hours.... You decide.\nSetting a time clock is simple. Inside the box you'll see a 24 hour dial. There are two \"timer dogs\" on the dial. One turns the timer switch on, allowing power to go to the filter pump, and the other turns the switch off, stopping power from going past the timer to the filter pump. Loosening the small screw on the timer dog allows you to slide the dog to any time on the dial. Reposition and retighten."))

Many sand filters use a top mounted multiport valve, located on the top center of the filter tank. The advantages of a Multiport valve are that they have, well, multiple ports. This allows for more options than simply Filter or Backwash.\n\nMultiport valves usually have 6 positions (Some Jacuzzi valves have 7 and some American valves have 8). The positions are usually labeled: Filter, Backwash, Rinse,Example of a Multiport Valve Recirculate, Closed and Drain/Waste. These are described below in more detail.\n\nWhen you move the multiport valve from Filter to Backwash, (always shut pump off first) you are reversing the direction of water into and out of the filter.

Chlorine generators are attractive to pool owners simply because they eliminate the need to store, buy, transport and handle chlorine. They are not an alternative to chlorine, but actually make their own chlorine from regular table salt. The pool water passes through a generator cell that creates the chlorine within the pool water.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nAs pool water passes through the chlorine generator cell, pumped through by your filter pump, the salt in the water is turned into Hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid is the exact same component that is produced when any chlorine is added to pool water, whether you use sticks, tablets, granular or liquid. As the water returns to the pool, it will introduce the newly produced chlorine, preventing algae, bacteria and killing micro-organisms, creating a safe and sanitary swimming environment.\n\nOK?  How does it really work?\n\nThis mild, pleasant saline water is sanitized through the process of electrolysis, as mentioned above. The electrolytic cell, through the use of a small electric current, breaks down the water into its basic elements, Hydrogen and Oxygen. By adding small quantities of granulated salt (much like household table salt - NaCI), Hypochlorous Acid (common chlorine) is produced. During the process, the Hypochlorous Acid (Chlorine) is ultimately converted back to salt. Thus, the salt does not get \"used up\". Salt only needs to be \"topped off\" once or twice a year and only to replace salt lost due to water splash-out, bather drag off or filter backwashing.\n\nSalt in My Pool?\n\nThe salt level required to maintain a safe, chlorinated pool is about 2500 to 4000 PPM (parts per million). The human body cannot taste salt until the PPM is around 5000. As a reference point, the ocean is around 40000 ppm. The amount of salt in the pool is usually not noticeable. Once the salt is added to the pool, there is no need to add salt on a yearly basis unless the pool is drained or a significant amount of water is removed. Also, the salt level is low enough so there is no danger of equipment corrosion. Chlorine generator users also report the water is softer, leaving a more refreshed feeling after swimming."))
