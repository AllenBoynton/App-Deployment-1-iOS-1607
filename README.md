Pool Buddy App
Version 1.32

Ran into error which would not allow me to run the application. After Googling it, many souces said to download Cocoapods and install a pod named, GoogleAnalytics. In order to do so I needed to place project on my desktop. I performed the procedure as well as turned of Bitmap encoding. I was then up and running. 
I had to replace my github file with my new updated desktop version. This was done at 12:10pm Tuesday, July 26, 2016. Hope all is running well. There is now cocoapods on my project and to run it, you MUST run the WHITE .xcworkspace file to run the application.
