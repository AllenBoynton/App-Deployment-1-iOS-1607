Pool Buddy App
Version 1.32

This is my first project that allowed me to start an application from start-up to near deployment. This is the pool owners pocket guide to pools. It contains a glossary of all the categories of pool equipment, chemicals, tools, etc. This can be marketed as an Enterprise app or a personal app. Other features are reminders, pool problem solver and future for a live chat.
This is my project board by Trello: https://trello.com/b/i8Oy0DPb/project-docs-template-allen-boynton-pool-buddy

There is now cocoapods on my project and to run it, you MUST run the WHITE .xcworkspace file to run the application.

* Readme is being updated soon to reflect a true READme file.
